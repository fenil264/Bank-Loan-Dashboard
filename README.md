# Bank Loan Report

## Overview

Bank Loan Report is an interactive analytics dashboard for banks and financial analysts. It helps visualize, manage, and understand loan applications, disbursed funds, payment collections, and overall loan portfolio health. This project leverages real-world loan data and presents it through easy-to-read dashboards with charts and tables.

## Why This Project?

Loans are vital for personal and business financial growth. Analyzing loan data helps banks make smarter decisions, manage risks, detect fraud, and meet regulatory standards. The aim of this project is to simplify the understanding of complex loan data so banks can improve their practices and customer offerings.

## Features

- Summarizes total loan applications, funded amount, and payments received.
- Tracks average interest rates and debt-to-income (DTI) ratios.
- Breaks down loans by purpose (e.g., debt consolidation, car, small business).
- Analyzes loans by term length, home ownership, employment duration, and state.
- Separates performing vs. non-performing loans to help with risk management.
- Portfolio performance tracking and compliance checking.
- Interactive visuals for time trends, geography, loan status, and more.

## Loan Data Lifecycle

The dashboard covers the full process, from application through repayment:

1. **Application** – Data collected via online and paper forms.
2. **Credit & Identity Check** – Credit history, personal identification, and fraud prevention.
3. **Verification** – Employment and income checks.
4. **Risk Assessment & Approval** – Review of DTI, collateral, and risk profile.
5. **Agreement & Disbursement** – Signing and releasing funds.
6. **Repayment & Monitoring** – Ongoing monitoring of payments, defaults, and portfolio status.

The data sources include direct applications, credit reports, internal bank records, online banking portals, and third-party services.
